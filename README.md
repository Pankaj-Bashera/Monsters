## 📌 Overview
The **Monster Problem Simulation** models a grid-based environment where a player must escape from monsters using pathfinding and survival strategies.  
It is inspired by a **CSES problem** and extended to test AI behavior, survival optimization, and simulation performance.

This project was developed during the **Summer PEP (Programming Enhancement Program)** to explore:
- Advanced pathfinding algorithms
- AI-driven movement
- Risk-aware strategy planning
- Simulation analysis & visualization

---

## 🎮 Features
- **Grid-Based Simulation** – N×M grid with walls, exits, player & monster positions.
- **Monster AI** – BFS (primary) with optional DFS, A*, Greedy Best-First Search.
- **Player Escape Strategies**:
  - Random Movement (baseline)
  - Shortest Path to Exit (Dijkstra’s)
  - Risk-Aware Pathfinding (avoids high monster density)
- **Visualization** – Matplotlib animations, color-coded cells.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Survival Time
  - Escape Probability
  - Optimal Path Length
